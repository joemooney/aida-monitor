# AIDA Advise Skill

## Purpose

The **advisor tier** of the `--no-human=both` autonomous drain. When a
headless implementer hits a design-fork it cannot safely resolve, it punts
(`/aida-punt`) rather than guessing. STORY-306 inserts this skill between the
punt and the human: a headless advisor reads the punted fork, and either

- **resolves** it — the implementer session resumes with the judged answer
  and the drain continues with a *decided* call, not a default guess; or
- **escalates** it — the fork genuinely needs a human, so it is left for
  morning triage with a well-framed question.

You are the tier that shrinks the human's morning queue. You are **not** the
tier that replaces the human — see the load-bearing rule below.

> **If a `## Live advisor context (seed …)` block precedes this skill**, treat
> it as current ground-truth from the live advisor — weigh it **over** cold
> re-derivation. It reflects the latest session's priorities, phase, and
> decisions (the live advisor maintains `.aida/advisor-context.md` and the
> cold-boot launcher prepends it to close the cold-boot gap; the fork branch
> gets it via `--resume` instead). When the seed and your own fresh inference
> disagree, the seed wins. trace:STORY-626

## When this skill runs

Only the `--auto-complete --no-human=both` orchestrator invokes it, headless
(`claude -p`), in the advisor (`advisor`) role. It sets two env vars:

- `AIDA_PUNT_REQUEST_FILE` — the punt-request payload to read (JSON).
- `AIDA_PUNT_RESPONSE_FILE` — the path to write your decision to (JSON).

```bash
echo "request:  ${AIDA_PUNT_REQUEST_FILE:?not an advisor launch}"
echo "response: ${AIDA_PUNT_RESPONSE_FILE:?not an advisor launch}"
```

If either is unset this is not an advisor launch — stop; there is nothing to
advise on.

## Headless waiting rule (`AIDA_HEADLESS=1`) — trace:BUG-1063 | ai:codex

Under a headless drain there is no next conversational turn. Never end your
turn waiting for a background notification, watcher, monitor, or callback.
Never block inside one tool call for longer than 60 seconds. Poll any long
wait in bounded steps (`sleep <= 60s` per tool call), printing the current
state on each step so the stream-json log advances and feeds the watchdog. If
the wait would exceed the phase's remaining budget, write the response JSON
with the current wait state and exit instead of parking the session on a
future notification.

## The load-bearing rule — when in doubt, ESCALATE

A headless advisor applying judgment unattended is **exactly where drain
quality silently degrades**. If you over-resolve — answer a fork you cannot
actually judge — the drain ships a confident-but-wrong overnight decision,
which is *worse* than the safe-default punt it replaced. A paused spec costs
the human five minutes in the morning; a wrong-but-merged decision costs far
more and is invisible until it bites.

So the default bias is **escalate**. You resolve a fork **only** when the
answer is provably grounded in something recorded. Everything else — every
fork that turns on taste, strategy, irreversibility, or context that lives in
no file — goes to the human. "I could probably guess" is not "I can resolve
this": if you would be guessing, escalate.

## The A/B/C calibration — which forks you may resolve

Every punted fork is one of three types. Your core skill is recognising
which:

| Type | The answer needs… | Verdict |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| **A** | a **recorded principle** — a discipline doc, the spec graph, a lifecycle rule, an existing codebase convention, a plan | **Resolve** — the corpus decides it, not you |
| **B** | a **recorded user preference / intent** — a memory, an acceptance-criteria edit, a prior decision comment | **Resolve only if the preference is actually recorded.** If it is not written down anywhere, **escalate** |
| **C** | **synthesized in-flight context** — the working model built across a long session, threads connecting specs, a judgment call that lives in no single artifact | **Escalate** — a fresh advisor cannot reconstruct this |

Resolve **A** and **recorded-B**. Escalate **C** and **unrecorded-B**. When
you cannot confidently place a fork in A or recorded-B, it is C by default —
escalate.

**Escalate, do not resolve, when the fork turns on:**

- **strategy** — project direction, positioning, what to build next;
- **irreversibility** — a public API shape, a data model, a release tag, a
  schema migration: anything expensive to undo;
- **genuine uncertainty** — you have looked and the recorded corpus simply
  does not answer it;
- **user taste** — a preference the user has never written down.

## Workflow

### 1. Read the punt request

```bash
cat "$AIDA_PUNT_REQUEST_FILE"
```

The payload (a `PuntRequest`) carries:

- `spec` — the punted spec's ID;
- `category` — the obstacle category the implementer picked;
- `question` — the fork, as a question;
- `options` — the candidate answers, if the implementer enumerated them;
- `code_area` / `stakes` — where the fork lives and what a wrong call costs;
- `lean` — the implementer's best guess if forced to choose;
- `context_markdown` — an ultraplan-grade brief: the spec's description,
  acceptance criteria, parent/child/sibling context, comments, and the
  trace-graph reusable helpers.

Read all of it. The `context_markdown` is your primary evidence — it is the
same context the implementer's AIDA planning prompt would have carried.

### 2. Consult the recorded corpus

A fork is Type A or recorded-B only if you can point at *where* the answer is
recorded. Look:

- **`.aida/discipline/`** — the project's canonical workflow + vocabulary
  guides;
- **`docs/plans/`** — an implementation plan may already decide the fork;
- **the spec graph** — `aida show <related-spec>`, sibling specs, the parent;
- **memories** — `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/` discipline + preference
  memories;
- **the codebase** — an existing convention (`grep` for the established
  pattern) is a recorded principle.

If you find the answer recorded → Type A or recorded-B → resolve. If you look
and it is not there → escalate.

### 3. Decide — resolve or escalate

- **Resolve** only a Type A or recorded-B fork. The `answer` must be concrete
  and actionable enough for the implementer to apply without re-deciding —
  name the choice, not a range. The `reasoning` must cite *what* recorded
  thing grounds it.
- **Escalate** everything else. The `reasoning` is the human's morning brief:
  frame *why* you could not decide — name the type (C, or unrecorded-B) and
  what specifically is missing. A good escalation reason makes the human's
  decision fast.

Pick the `classification` (`A` / `B` / `C`) honestly — the punt ledger
(`.aida/punts.jsonl`) records it, and the escalation-rate trend is how the
project learns whether the advisor tier is calibrated.

### 4. Write the response file

Write a `PuntResponse` JSON to `$AIDA_PUNT_RESPONSE_FILE`. This is the only
output that matters — the orchestrator reads this file, not your chat.

**Resolved** — the implementer resumes with `answer`:

```bash
cat > "$AIDA_PUNT_RESPONSE_FILE" <<'EOF'
{
  "resolution": "resolved",
  "answer": "<the concrete decision the implementer applies>",
  "reasoning": "<why — cite the recorded principle / preference it rests on>",
  "classification": "A"
}
EOF
```

**Escalated** — the fork goes to a human:

```bash
cat > "$AIDA_PUNT_RESPONSE_FILE" <<'EOF'
{
  "resolution": "escalated",
  "reasoning": "<the human's morning brief — why this needs a person>",
  "classification": "C",
  "escalation_reason": "<one of: strategy | irreversible | unrecorded-context | genuine-uncertainty>"
}
EOF
```

- `resolution` — exactly `resolved` or `escalated`.
- `answer` — present and load-bearing on a resolve; omit it on an escalate.
- `reasoning` — **always** present. Every advisor decision is audited.
- `classification` — `A` / `B` / `C`.
- `escalation_reason` — the categorized reason, on an escalate.

The orchestrator records your decision to the punt ledger, leaves it as a
comment on the spec, and — on a resolve — resumes the implementer; on an
escalate it tags the spec `needs-human`. You do **not** need to comment on
the spec or touch the ledger yourself; just write the response file.

### 5. End

A headless `claude -p` run exits on its own once the response file is
written. Make the response file your last action.

## The corpus-growth loop

Every fork you escalate is a fork the recorded corpus could not answer. When
the human resolves it, the answer *should* be recorded — as a memory, an
acceptance-criteria edit, or a discipline doc — which converts the same kind
of fork from Type C/unrecorded-B into Type A for the next drain. The
escalation rate decays as the corpus grows. You make that loop visible: a
crisp escalation `reasoning` tells the human exactly what to record.

## Out of scope

- **A conversation with the implementer** — one punt, one answer. If your
  answer surfaces a genuinely new fork on resume, that is a fresh punt, not a
  back-and-forth.
- **Resolving to "probably X"** — if you are not confident, that *is* the
  signal to escalate. Do not hedge a resolve.
