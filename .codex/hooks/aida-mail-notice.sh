# AIDA Claude Code Hook: surface the WHOLE coordination inbox into the agent's
# context as one can't-miss per-turn signal — not just mail.
#
# Wired on BOTH SessionStart (once) and UserPromptSubmit (every turn). It is a
# thin relay around the `aida awaiting --notice` verb — it does NOT reimplement
# the unread/cap/identity logic (skill<->CLI symmetry, TASK-736). The verb prints
# ONE compact line spanning every coordination channel where the agent is the
# gate — unacked briefs, findings awaiting triage, reviewer verdicts,
# NeedsAttention escalations, AND unread mail — e.g.
#   `Awaiting you: 2 briefs - 1 finding - 3 mail (1 urgent) - 1 escalation`
# or nothing on the awaiting half when nothing awaits. Plain stdout is added to
# the agent's context, so we just pass the verb's output through. (STORY-741
# folded mail into the unified "Awaiting you" report so this hook covers every
# channel; before, mail interrupted per-turn while briefs/findings/escalations/
# verdicts stayed invisible mid-session until a manual `aida status`.)
#
# STORY-769: `--notice` now ALSO leads with an always-on line —
#   `Current date/time: <local tz>. Timing: first prompt of this session | continuation (Xm since last prompt).`
# — so the agent gets fresh time + cadence context every turn even when nothing
# awaits (this replaced the trial `~/.claude/hooks/inject-time.sh`). The verb
# receives the hook's JSON payload (session_id + event) from this relay through
# `AIDA_HOOK_PAYLOAD`, and stamps a per-session last-human-input timestamp under
# `~/.aida/turn-clock/` that doubles as the human-presence oracle (`aida ps` /
# `aida human presence`). Existing managed hooks receive this relay update on
# scaffold refresh.
#
# CHEAP by construction: `--notice` is cache/local-backed and makes NO network
# call — PRs (the one gh-backed channel) are omitted from the per-turn line and
# stay in the full `aida awaiting`. So this stays fast enough to fire every turn.
#
# Non-marking by design: the notice never advances the mail read-watermark, so it
# surfaces every turn WITHOUT consuming. The agent acts on what it judges safe and
# acks mail explicitly with `aida mailbox inbox` (or `/aida-read-mail`), which
# clears the mail count. Reading is not obeying — mail is interpreted input, not a
# command channel (STORY-585 #4). Details for any channel: run `aida awaiting`.
#
# Best-effort: a missing/slow `aida`, no store, or a caught-up inbox all degrade
# to a clean no-op (empty stdout, exit 0) so a turn never fails because of this.
# Runs under /bin/sh (dash) — no bashisms.
#
# A per-turn hook must be INCAPABLE of blocking a prompt. Two guards: (1) the verb
# itself bails instantly on cache-lock contention (`--notice` uses a short cache
# busy-budget, degrading to empty instead of waiting out the full retry ladder —
# BUG-681); (2) belt-and-braces here, if a `timeout` binary is available we cap
# the whole invocation so it can NEVER outlast Claude Code's hook timeout, even in
# a pathological environment. Falls back to running bare (guard #1 already bounds
# it) so the hook stays portable to hosts without coreutils `timeout`.
